## About Me

I am a PhD student in the [Energy Efficient Cities initiative (EECi)](https://www.eeci.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, affiliated with the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). My research focuses on developing single/multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms for managing novel microgrid multi-energy systems comprising photovoltaic buildings, energy storage, and electric vehicles.

Prior to Cambridge, I obtained my MSc in Smart Building Technology and Management from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GPA: 3.96, Top 1%), and my BEng in Civil Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University.
